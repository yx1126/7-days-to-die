FORMAT OF PASSIVE SKILL RANGES:

Good:
	<multiply skill_level="1,5" value="1,1.04" />
	<multiply skill_level="5,11" value="1.04,1.07" />
	<multiply skill_level="11,19" value="1.07,1.1" />
Bad:
	<multiply skill_level="1,5" value="1,1.04" />
	<multiply skill_level="6,11" value="1.05,1.07" />
	<multiply skill_level="12,19" value="1.08,1.1" />

Do NOT "skip" any skill levels. The code does not like it. You want to make the code happy.
Unhappy code may want to use you as reactor shielding.



Repair balancing

Known A15.0 bug:
Repairing simple items like clubs does not work the same way as repairing assembled items like firearms.
*Should be fixed for 16 - at least it's on the list*

Club at QL 600:
no skills: 100 QL loss, max skills: 10 QL loss and no loss at QL 119 and below.
QL is multiplied.

Assembled items:  (work in progress)
no skills: 30 QL loss, max skills: 2 QL loss at every QL
QL repair loss is strictly subtracted from the QL.

Temporary workaround: Set all assembled items to "Gun smithing" and fudge the numbers to work out.

Don't bother reporting that this is actually the case...
