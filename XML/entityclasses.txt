<property name="AITask-3" value="Territorial"/>
	(unused in A16) see spawning.xml
	If an ENTITYSPAWNER has Territorial=true and TerritorialRange=distance and the entity_class (here) has AITask Territorial
	then an entity WILL return to it's spawn point (ignoring everything) when it exceeds this distance.

In general there are 2 classes of tasks in this entity system.
AITask- : movement task that decides what to do, possibly with the chosen target
AITarget- : targeting task, it determines what the entity should target


<property name="AITask-6" value="ApproachAndAttackTarget" data="class=EntityPlayer"/>
param2 : give up time
If the entity is chasing a target for this long it will potentially give up... unless the
target is still in range/sight, in which case the pursuit is continued.
Essentially you have to break LOS for this long.

An entity will be aggro again if attacked after it has stopped pursueing.
(bug in 16.0: Zombies never seem to stop pursueing)
