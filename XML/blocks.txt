File: BLOCKS.XML

The block naming convention for "basic" blocks (with interchangeable textures) is
[material|look|texture] [shape] [extra properties if needed]

[Materials]: Generally speaking, the texture. If you search for "concreteTrimBlock" because you need that look, having "Trim" as an extra property after the shape might not be helpful.

[Shape]: keeping it non-technical if possible.

block - basic full meter square.
half - value="Half"
quarter - value="Quarter"
eighth - value="Eighth" 
pyramid - value="Pyramid"
sheet - one side of a block, a billboard
sheet2 - value="shantyWall01Sheet2" - "shantyWall04Sheet2"
sheet3 - value="curtain"
sheet4 - value="HousingDecor/Boarded_windows" or other custom models
CTRSheet - like windows or glass panes
ramp - the basic 45 degree triangle shapes
stairs25 - value="StairsFilled" / "StairsFilledVerticalUV" 25 cm steps
stairs50 - value="StairsQuarterFilled" 50 cm steps
stairsBoard - value="Stairs"
pole - value="Pole"
poleSupportCtr - value="pole_diagonal_centered"
poleSupport - value="pole_diagonal"
poleSupport2 - value="pole_diagonal_2"
crossCtr - value="pole_diagonal_centered_cross"
cross - value="pole_diagonal_cross"
plate - value="Plate"
CTRPlate - value="PlateCentered"
TRN - value="Terrain" 
wedge - value="Wedged60Full"
wedgeTip - value="Wedged60Tip"
curb - sidewalk  value="Curb"
CNRCurb - value="Curb_Corner"
pillar100 - value="Pole1m" 100 cm version
pillar50 - 50 cm version
CNRFull - value="WedgedCornerFull" corner with a full (square) base for outside pyramid roofs
CNRRamp -  value="WedgedCorner" corner with a half (triangle) base for outside pyramid roofs
CNRInside - value="WedgedInnerFull"  concave shape for roofs

NOTE: This plan was implemented only partially (tree, cnt) - maybe some day... or another system will be used.
I'll leave it in for future reference. Gazz

Many blocks like "scrapIronPile" have unique models / shapes.
For these I would use 
MDL [type|category] [Name]



[Type]:

cnt - container, typically loot;  (I would call block-based containers like "CntWeaponsBlock")
      I would also mislabel the damage 2 car so it stays with the others.
      Useful filters and a useful list >> strict adherence to rules.
      Also containers that downgrade into loot containers. "cntSupplyCrateShamway"
fnt - furniture. Desks, chairs, potted plants
elt - electrical things like control panels that we don't have a clear purpose for, yet
lgt - all lights, including wall torches and candles
tree - trees, grass, shrubbery, cactus
plt - all other plants, shrubberiers, farming crops, or blocks that fulfil the purpose of a plant even if its just a pickup.
wrk - workstation of any kind
trp - traps, spikes, mines that DO something 
sgn - signs
dst - destroyed or damaged... something.
prt - particle effects like snowstorm
drw - doors, hatches, windows
otr - other

This allows you to filter by categories, such as "find me all trees". It doesn't break the full text search.

Example

MDLdrwSteelDoor1_v1
MDLfntSchooldesk
MDLcntCooler

Use of "Extends" in blocks.xml:

This can be tricky so pay attention. =)

"Extend" copies upgrade and downgrade blocks/properties.
As you can see in the file you can mix and match, keeping the upgrade material and amount thereof but overwriting the target block.


For repairs you cannot un-extend a material.

If you extend a wooden door that is repaired with wood, then use that to make a metal door...
the metal door will require the wood in addition to the metal repair materials you assign.


Blocks using extends now do give the resources from the parent's destroy event.
If a block is using extends, but has its own destroy event, it will use that one instead.


<block id="1456" name="cntCar03Red">

	<drop event="Fall" name="cntCar03BlueDamage1" count="0" prob="0" stick_chance="1" />
	<drop event="Fall" name="cntCar03WhiteDamage1" count="1" prob="1.0" stick_chance="1" />

Without "unextending" that *specific* property the drop would be a cntCar03BlueDamage1 if that's the fall event of the parent block.


Extend should be the first entry in a block / item.
The file is read sequentially and if you put 
	<property name="Shape" value="WedgedCornerFull" />
above the extend it reads that line and THEN reads all the properties from
the parent block - including the shape.


Also:
Extend CAN NOT extend from a model
<block id="431" name="mineCandyTin">
to a shape
<block id="1408" name="rScrapIronPlateMine">

Sure, you can do it but then the texture atlas cannot be baked because the block inherits properties that it shouldn't.

Selective "Extends"

For blocks/items.xml you need to use this syntax:
<property name="Extends" param1="<excluded defs>" />


for entityclasses.xml like this:
<.... ignore="<excluded defs>" ... >

Excluded defs are properties like "Downgrade" or "FuelValue" (comma delimited)
so you can better tailor an extended block to your needs.

We cannot exclude the drop definitions so far


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

<property name="CanMobsSpawnOn" value="true" />

The default value for a block is now FALSE.

Static spawners in prefabs / POI completely ignore this flag.


A placed bedroll ("your" bedroll, not any that exists) works like a claim stone.
It blocks zombie spawns in a rectangular area of 31x31 meters from bedrock to sky.
(that's 15 + 1 + 15m)

<drop event="Destroy" name="scrapIron" count="1,2" prob="1" />

count="min,max" specifies the min/max count, prob="x" specifies if ANY are dropped with this probability.
This is only applied to the very last destroy event on a block.
It cannot be used on a harvest event as here the total amount has to be fixed.


<drop event="Destroy" name="[recipe]" />
half of the ingredients of the first recipe for this item/block are awarded.
Currently it's always half and you cannot specify a factor.
Also if you specify a [recipe] you cannot/should not specify other items for this drop event.


Without a destroy event the block will always "drop self".
You can use this to make road signs or anything else collectible.

Looping fall events.

<drop event="Fall" name="destroyedStone" count="1" prob="0.1"  stick_chance="1" />

If a falling block decides to "stick" on top of a block with
	<property name="StabilitySupport" value="false" />
it will fall again.

Then it will stick on top of the same block again.
Then... do you see a pattern there?

Either completely avoid blocks falling "as themselves" or assign a stick chance <1 so it would eventually give up and poof.

Collision masks

	<property name="Collide" value="melee,bullet,rocket" />
	<property name="Collide" value="meleeweapons,bullets,rockets" />

These are functionally identical. Only the start of the string is checked.


Personal preference:

<block id="385" name="metalTrussingBlock">
	<property name="Collide" value="movement,melee,rocket" /> <!-- -rocket -->

In *my* opinion you should be allowed to shoot arrows through those if bullets fit.
If you agree you can remove all occurrences of this with one search&replace.

Keep in mind that this also allows rockets to pass so
it *can* be a problem depending on your server settings and rules.

(A17) The Path property
	<property name="Path" value="solid"/>
	This is a shortcut for the AI pathfinding and quickly determines that this block (like a forge or pillar100) can not be pathed into from any direction.
	Blocks using Model cube, cube_glass and cube_frame are automatically flagged.

	May or may not work / be used:
	<property name="Path" value="edge"/>
	This is used for something like a cornered pole block where the AI is directed to look at the edges of the block space to find an obstacle.

Butcher tools are currently not supported in blocks.
Maybe later. Not a priority.

	<drop event="Harvest" name="femur" tool_category="Butcher" count="1" prob=".4" />

Disassembling (wrench)

	<drop event="Destroy" name="barbedFence" count="1" tool_category="Disassemble" />
	<drop event="Harvest" name="headlight" count="1" prob="0.2" tool_category="Disassemble" />

Both harvest and destroy events can be limited to only fire if the correct tool is used.

This does not disable ungated events. They fire as well.


Note that you do NOT get the "disassemble" animation with just a destroy event.
You need to do it this way:
	<drop event="Harvest" name="" count="0" tool_category="Disassemble" />
	<drop event="Destroy" name="workbench" count="1" tool_category="Disassemble" />

Farming / Harvest yield of farmed crops.

This only affects block class "CropsGrown".

The "fertile_level" (defined in materials.xml) of the block that the plant is growing on can affect the harvest yield.

To use that you add 
	<property name="CropsGrown.BonusHarvestDivisor" value="5.0" />    (float, default=VeryLargeNumber)

to the to-be-harvested block.
This will generate bonus items when the plant is harvested.

The number of additional harvest items is

= ( "fertile_level" of the block directly below ) / ( CropsGrown.BonusHarvestDivisor )

So for a fertile_level of 5 and a BonusHarvestDivisor of 1.2 you get +4 harvest items.
Now if you were to make some fertiliser and further increase the fertile level of the dirt...

PlantGrowing.IsRandom growth timers

All the coders tell me that using "random" for the timer is much cheaper in CPU terms so that would be a good thing for a farm that can have thousands of plants.

Unfortunately it was a bit short on the max duration so couldn't actually be used for anything.
Now, when using PlantGrowing.IsRandom the max value for PlantGrowing.GrowthRate has been increased to 63.

At the setting of 63 I timed that to be 43 - 106 minutes.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Trees growing to variable sizes depending on the soil.

Any plant/block using
<property name="PlantGrowing.

to upgrade will check the 

<property name="PlantGrowing.FertileLevel" value="xxx" />
of the TARGET block first.

If this  PlantGrowing.FertileLevel  is higher than the  fertile_level  of the block directly below then the upgrade will not occur.
Score one for biome diversity. =)

Support and multiblocks

(A15) On destruction, blocks with "MultiBlockDim" are properly cleaned up, leaving no invisible support blocks in mid-air. (Sorry! =)


Multiblocks and  <property name="StabilitySupport" value="false" />

If the multiblock's Y dimension is >1 it will self destruct.


In general, multiblocks can not have a horizontal dimension >7.
Lead programmer said so and he knows things.
He added a special exception for vertical dimension (trees).

Upgrade and hit sounds

When you upgrade a block then the tool plays a sound on every hit.
This sound is from the material value of the upgrade RESOURCE.

<property name="CustomUpgradeSound" value="Crafting/place_block_wood" />
This sound is played once when the upgrade is taking effect.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Upgrade and hit sounds from textures

Any 	<property name="Shape" value="ModelEntity" />
does NOT need a texture entry.

If one is given, the sound attached to the texture in blocktextures (and baked into that other file I cant remember)
WILL play when this block is hit, overriding the block's material assignment.

Any 	<property name="Shape" value="Ext3dModel" />
DOES need a (dummy) texture entry.

Transparent / cutout meshes and frame blocks

added <Property name="Frame"/> to each master frame block.

This marks the block as a frame so in the code it sends a multiplier to the inside rendering to either happen or not.
If the property is there then it will render the back faces of the geo, shrink it slightly (so z-fighting doesn't happen), and flip the normals to point inside.

Related: 
*Changed: Defaulted transparent blocks to have no backface culling per Joel’s request for glass blocks.

Global UV for dummies (A16)

WTF is that?
It means that if a texture is "global", the block texture will ALWAYS display with the same side up
even if the block is rotated in a way that would display this side upside down or to the right.

This is defined per texture in blocktextures.xml.
(which does nothing until the (opaque) atlas is baked)

On some faces (the steps of stairs) this is not desired because they would look wrong in some rotations. There you set it to local.

This setting can be overridden in blocks.xml on a per block / face base:

<property name="UseGlobalUV" value="D,D,L,D,D,G" />
<property name="UseGlobalUV" value="Local" />
<property name="UseGlobalUV" value="Global" />

All values are case sensitive.
D = use default from blocktextures.xml
L = force local
G = force global

A16 features all new UV code so in principle it does not matter at all which "side" is actually facing which way.
The only blocks that were set to local UV are those that do NOT match any adjacent (other) blocks that they might touch.
Like poles, supports or pillars.
Their texture would never "continue on an adjacent block" and for diagonal polesthe wood texture might as well "run the right way".
So these use the local override on the block.

PS: Normal people don't need to know any of these weird graphics shenanigans so don't worry about it.
I'm only documenting this for a handful of crazies.

Something *I* stumbled over recently:

While
\Assets\Textures\Blocks\blocktextures.xml
controls the setup (global/local) per texture, it does not directly affect the game.

Rebuilding the texture atlas also generates
\Assets\AssetBundles\BlockTextureAtlases\ta_opaquexml.txt 
(for instance)

and *that* file is what makes the textures use a default of local/global ingame.

Shape="new" and plants.

The new shapes do not allow to pass light through them.

This means the corn will not get any "AO light" at the base of the trunk and thus "die" instantly after planting.

Add the property "LightOpacity" where needed.


Also, a block uses the higher LightOpacity value of MATERIAL and SHAPE
...and Shape="new" always has LightOpacity="255".


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Blocks and light and plants.

There are 16 possible light values.

Full sunlight = 15.
Full darkness = 0.

If the light is reduced by traveling through a block with LightOpacity="6" then the light value below this block is 9.

Every square that light has to travel "sideways" to reach the block subtracts 1.

Plants require 3 to grow.

There may also be a max distance that light can travel horizontally.

Textures and the map.

The "top" face of a block determines the pixel colour that it displays on the map UI.

Here it's texture 277, bright blue.
	<property name="Texture" value="277,574,576,577,578,575" />

Block default placement:  Place + HandleFace

Place overrides HandleFace so you can only have one or the other.

Upgrading and downgrading to random block targets.

All of this... works now:

	<property class="UpgradeBlock"> <property name="ToBlock" value="lootWasteland" /> </property>

	<property name="DowngradeBlock" value="lootWasteland" />

	<property name="UpgradeRated.ToBlock" value="lootWasteland" />

	<property name="PlantGrowing.Next" value="lootWasteland" />

Loot placeholders are defined in loot.xml.

(A17) SortOrder / Sort Order on the Creative menu.

We changed the display order on the creative menu from "blindfold and dartboard" to something more organised.

There are 2 properties for sortorder.
	<property name="SortOrder1" value="x"/>  (string - try to keep it short for performance)
	<property name="SortOrder2" value="y"/>

When deciding in which order to display items on the creative menu,
the game concatenates SortOrder1 and SortOrder1, then sorts by the resulting string.
In the above example the sort string is "xy" and would sort below "xf".

The reason for this split is that major groups like "brick blocks" can extend their SortOrder1 from the master material block.
Individual shapes have their own specific SortOrder2.
That makes the system modular and gives me fewer headaches.

<property name="EconomicValue" value="xxx" />  (integer)

"EconomicBundleSize" :
Was put in because the coder did not want a float there. =)
A trader will trade this many items as the smallest bundle. You won't be able to sell a single small rock.
The "EconomicValue" applies to the bundle.


The price of an assembled item (gun) is equal to the sum of it's parts.

First step was to figure out *some* rules to get some consistency into this and not having to reinvent the wheel for every item.

Rarity of the resource.
In my latest game I have some 500 brass scrap and just the excavation for my base's walls got me about 100000 small rocks.
I'm trying to figure out a base value for "how long does it take to acquire this resource".

Forge required.
Resource value x 1.2

Common tool required. Cooking pot or grill - essentially free with a forge so does not stack with that bonus.
Resource value x 1.2

Rare tool required. Crucible, beaker...
Resource value x 1.5

Farming required. Not hard but time-consuming.
Resource value x 1.33

Skill / perk / recipe / special scavenging or disassembling required.
There it gets muddy.
Im thinking _up to_ x1.5 based on uhh... best guess?

Can only be found: x5
