How random loot generation works now:

A loot container defines a list of items and/or lootgroups, a count, and a size configuration.

The size configuration is the strict limit on the what the container can hold, and this limit can be reached even if
your container specifies a much smaller count value.

The loot containers count value specified how many if the items in the containers loot list should be selected randomly.
NOTE: that the same item could be chosen more than one time.

If the chosen item is an item then the item is spawned into the container according to its count.

However if the chosen item is a lootgroup then a lootgroup is spawned into the container.

Loot Groups:

NOTE: if a lootgroup says count="all" then all subitems will be spawned.

A lootgroup functions identically to a container in its spawning logic. A lootgroup has a count like a container does.
The count value specifies how many items out of the lootgroup should be spawned each time the lootgroup is spawend. This
can lead to multiplicitive behaviour if it is setup that way for example:

<lootgroup name="group1" count="2" level="25,50">
	...
</lootgroup>

<lootcontainer id="1" count="2" size="4,4">
	<item group="group1" count="2">
</lootcontainer>

The above example would spawn the contents of group1 8 times. Here's why:
The container is told to spawn 2 items, since there's only 1 item in the container it will choose group1
2 times. Each time group1 is chosen, the container <item group="group1" count="2"> line specifies that
the contents of group1 should be spawned 2 times. So on the first iteration of the container group1 is spawned
2 times, and then again on the second iteration.

The group1 lootgroup specifies that each time it is spawned (recall 4 times in the example) that is should
select 2 items from its list.

So the above example would spawn 8 items into the container.

NOTE: it is safe to specify groups and counts that exceed the containers capacity. If the containers space
is exceeded excess items will not be spawned, and items will automatically stack to fill the container.

Adjusting gun accuracy / spread (way obsolete in A17+)

Crosshair_min_distance(int): the min size of the crosshairs on screen
			Increasing it also increases the spread of Magazine_item_ray_spreads
Crosshair_max_distance(int): the max size of the crosshairs on screen

Magazine_item_ray_spreads: The projectile spread, both zoomed and hip-fired
			Used for shotguns and pistols.

			"Magazine_item_ray_spreads" generates a wider cone if the player is moving fast.

Rays_spread:		Technically deprecated but still used because... it's what we got.
			This one works for launchers but has a completely different scale.

Accuracy: 		Attribute, can scale with QL
			The spread of the weapon if hip-fired.
			If Accuracy is defined, Magazine_item_ray_spreads is floored to zero
			and aimed fire is dead on.
			Used for rifles.

			"Accuracy" uses a CYLINDER for the shot projection, not a cone.

Zoom_max_out / Zoom_max_in: Those are plain FOV values

Ranges measured at a FOV of 72. (only noobs use the default of 50)
For FOV 50 multiply them by about 1.5.

	s0.095, 8.5m, 1m spread
gunSawedOffPumpShotgun / blunderbuss
	s0.74, 6m, 1m spread
gunPumpShotgun
	s0.835, 11m, 1m spread (shell) = 5.2°
	s0.605, 25m, 1m spread (slug) = 2.29°


Spread 5°: 2.6m @ 30m
Spread 5°: 2.6m @ 30m

Spread 15°: 4.3m @ 16m   or 14.5 sqm

A zombie standing inside a 1m spread cone covers 55% of the whole cone.
